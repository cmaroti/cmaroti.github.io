I earned my undergraduate degree in Linguistics from Harvard and subsequently
worked in investment banking at Mizuho, a large Japanese bank, helping to
establish their high yield bond origination platform in the U.S. There I
gained experience structuring and executing debt capital markets transactions
and optimizing companiesâ€™ capital structures. To complement my strong
analytical background, I have lifelong experience in the arts and am looking
forward to bringing that creativity to a new career in the interdisciplinary
and exciting world of data science.
